His code of honor is legendary, after all, and reflects not only upon himself but every other who make their living through relieving others of their wealth.Of course, this code of honor is a strange, confusing thing to any who aren’t thieves.For instance, master thieves may never turn down an opportunity to steal, or sacrifice another thief in order to preserve their own lives.Master thieves are not simply thieves with greater skills than another: they are masters of thieves, the aristocracy of the underworld, and they must act like it.Master thieves are planners and plotters, whether working alone or with a hand-picked crew. Becoming a master thief requires the dedication of a lifetime — it is a path that must be decided upon at a young age and pursued with the diligence that sorcerers must commit to their study of rites and rituals. Agility, intelligence, and the means by which even the most highly guarded of locations can be broken into… all of this a master thief must learn.",
